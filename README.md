# BinarySearchTree
Implemented Binary Search tree using Java with Decorator, strategy, Iterator and Null node pattern

Used strategy pattern to allow to determine how the tree will be ordered when a tree object is created.

Implemented an iterator for BinarySearch Tree class to iterate through binary search tree elements.

Used the null object pattern to represent head and leaf nodes in the tree.

Implemented two separate and independent decorators for Javaâ€™s Iterator. The first decorator
only return Strings that start with a vowel. The constructor for the decorator needs one argument
of type Iterator<String>. The second decorator also only works on Strings. The
second iterator capitalizes all the strings it returns in its next() method.
